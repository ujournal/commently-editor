Welcome to this **Markdown text example**. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax.

You can use it to create:

- **Bold text** using asterisks (`**bold**`) or underscores (`__bold__`).
- _Italic text_ using single asterisks (`*italic*`) or underscores (`_italic_`).
- A combination of **_bold and italic text_** (`**_bold and italic text_**`).

Here is a blockquote, which is useful for calling special attention to a quote:

> This is a blockquote example.
> It can span multiple lines and paragraphs if each line starts with a `>` character.

### Lists and Links

You can create both unordered and ordered lists:

#### Unordered List

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

#### Ordered List

1.  First item in the list.
2.  Second item in the list.
3.  Third item in the list.

Links are created using square brackets for the link text and parentheses for the URL, like this: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).

### Code Blocks

You can also include `inline code` or multi-line code blocks:

```python
# This is a code block in Python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
```
